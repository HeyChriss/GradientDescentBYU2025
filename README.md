# NoraPal Multi-Agent AI Assistant for Students

A comprehensive AI-powered platform designed to enhance the first-year college experience through intelligent task automation and personalized assistance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project implements a **multi-agent system** with an orchestrator agent that manages workflow between four specialized agents. Each agent is designed to handle specific tasks, creating a seamless and intelligent user experience.

### Orchestrator Agent
The orchestrator serves as the central coordinator, analyzing user requests and routing them to the appropriate specialized agent. It manages:
- Request classification and routing
- Inter-agent communication
- Response aggregation
- Workflow optimization

### The Four Specialized Agents

#### 1. Research & Web Scraping Agent
- Performs intelligent web searches using Tavily API
- Scrapes and processes educational content
- Helps students understand complex concepts from their classes
- Provides curated information from reliable sources

#### 2. Canvas Integration Agent
- Connects directly to Canvas LMS
- Retrieves assignments, due dates, and grades
- Accesses course materials and announcements
- Fetches module content and learning resources
- Provides a unified view of all academic information

#### 3. Flashcard Generation Agent
- Creates custom flashcards from any topic
- Generates study materials from course content
- Supports active recall and spaced repetition learning
- Helps students prepare for exams efficiently

#### 4. Email Management Agent
- Drafts professional emails
- Composes messages based on context
- Sends emails directly through Gmail integration
- Streamlines communication with professors and peers
